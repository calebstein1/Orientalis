        Melcadia features a vast and diverse landscape consisting of deep caves, towering mountains, dense forests, and more!
        The evil force has caused the creatures that inhabit these landscapes to become aggressive, so Tara will need to tread cautiously and defend herself.
        Tara can begin to cleanse the land by defeating bosses that live in the deepest, darkest corners of these areas, but it won't be easy!
