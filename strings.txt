~1 Mayor after daybreak
hi there, tara, what can i do
for you today?

~2 Guy by western cave during night sequence
earthquake woke you too, huh?
sure sounded like it came
from back in the cave.
i'd go check it out myself
but... well you know...

~3 Tara's friend before giant mole is defeated
hi tara!
beautiful day, isn't it?
so hey, my dad was drinking
again last night.
might be a good idea to steer
clear until he sobers up
*sigh* i wish he'd quit, if
not for himself, then for me

~4 Tara's friend's dad drunk
get out *hic* of here!
i'm in no mood for guests

~5 Guy warning about fog in the woods
if you're planning on heading
into the woods south of town,
make sure you're prepared for
the thick fog you'll find
there.
can't hardly see a thing

~6 Guy warning about molten rock in caves
those earthquakes are causing
some molten rock to rise up
to the surface.
be careful if you're heading
down into the cave, it's
pretty dark, and a step on
those molten rocks will
sure hurt

a big adventure to save
the world! that's so cool!

~10 Mom before meeting future traveler
normally i'd tell you to go
back to bed and *not* to
sneak out and explore what
caused that earthquake,
but you are my daughter,
and i know you'll sneak out
no matter what i say, so
instead i'll just tell you
to please be careful.
oh, and maybe let your little
brother know you're going
out if you haven't already

~11 Mom after meeting future traveler, before daybreak
welcome home, tara,
i know it's nearly daybreak,
but you've had a long night,
you might want to head to
your room and have a quick
nap before you head off again

~12 Mom after daybreak

your bed's always made up
for you in case you need it

~13 Giant mole pre battle

~18 Clothing designer before cult
welcome to our quiet village
i design clothing, and this
is the perfect place for me
to get my inspiration.

he's probably outside playing
right now

~19 Clothing designer during cult
oh what can i do?
as soon as those odd folks
dressed in all white showed
up, my son disappeared!
you think they might be
responsible? well, it would
make sense.
they came from the deep","woods to the west...
if you're planning on
investigating, please take
this cross pendant.
i'll pray for your success

~20 Clothing designer during cult after getting cross

keep you warm in the coldest
of climates.
good luck on the rest
of your adventure!
